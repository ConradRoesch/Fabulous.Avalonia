Fabulous.Avalonia brings the great development experience of Fabulous to Avalonia, allowing you to take advantage of the latest cross-platform UI framework from Microsoft with a tailored declarative UI DSL and clean architecture.

Deploy to any platform supported by Avalonia, such as Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux and more!

```fs
/// A simple Counter app

type Model =
    { Count: int }

type Msg =
    | Increment
    | Decrement

let init () =
    { Count = 0 }

let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | Increment -> { model with Count = model.Count + 1 }
    | Decrement -> { model with Count = model.Count - 1 }

let view model =
    VStack(spacing = 16.) {
        Image(ImageSource.fromString "fabulous.png", Aspect.AspectFit)

        TextBlock($"Count is {model.Count}")

        Button("Increment", Increment)
        Button("Decrement", Decrement)
    }
    
#if MOBILE
    let app model = SingleViewApplication(view model)
#else
    let app model = DesktopApplication(Window(view model))
#endif
```

## Getting Started

You can start your new Fabulous.Avalonia app in a matter of seconds using the dotnet CLI templates.  
For a starter guide see our [Get Started with Fabulous.Avalonia](https://fabulous.dev/avalonia/get-started).

```sh
dotnet new install Fabulous.Avalonia.Templates
dotnet new fabulous-avalonia -n MyApp
```
If you are using Linux net7.0-android and net7.0-ios are not supported. So we need to remove them from the TargetFrameworks

```fsharp
<PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```
